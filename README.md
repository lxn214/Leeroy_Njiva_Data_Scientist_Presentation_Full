Project Title: Analysis of Delivery Timeliness and Prediction of Delays
Project Overview
This project delves into the analysis of delivery timeliness within a logistics network, identifying potential delays and predicting future delays using machine learning models. The aim is to enhance operational efficiency and reliability in delivery schedules through data-driven insights and predictive analytics.
Data Sources
The analysis utilizes three main data sources:
•	GPS Data (GPS_data.csv): Contains real-time location data of delivery vehicles.
•	Shipment Bookings (Shipment_bookings.csv): Details scheduled collection and delivery times, vehicle types, and other booking specifics.
•	New Bookings (New_bookings.csv): Includes data on future bookings to forecast potential delays.
Key Features
•	Parsing datetime fields with timezone awareness.
•	Data merging and cleaning to ensure quality and usability.
•	Predictive modeling to anticipate potential delivery delays.
Repository Contents
•	GPS_data.csv - GPS tracking data of delivery vehicles.
•	Shipment_bookings.csv - Historical data on shipment bookings.
•	New_bookings.csv - Data on future bookings.
•	analysis_script.py - Python script containing all the preprocessing, analysis, and modeling code.
•	requirements.txt - A list of Python libraries required to run the code.
Setup and Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	Navigate to the project directory: 
cd delivery-timeliness-analysis 
3.	Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt 
Usage
Run the script to perform the analysis:
python analysis_script.py 
Analysis Outcomes
•	On-Time Delivery Analysis: 75.20% of deliveries met the on-time delivery threshold.
•	Delay Identification: Identified specific instances and patterns of delays in the logistics operations.
•	Predictive Modeling: Developed a machine learning model to predict potential delays, achieving a best accuracy of 49.7%.
Visualizations
•	Feature Importance
•	ROC Curve
•	Precision-Recall Curve
•	Confusion Matrix
These visualizations aid in understanding the model's performance and the significance of different features in predicting delays.
Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by:
•	Enhancing the predictive model.
•	Adding more data sources to improve the robustness of the analysis.
•	Improving the visualization of results.
